# Implementation Plan: US1626026 - Update CLI to use new ALKS JS and new params

## Milestone 1: Update ALKS JS Integration
- Update the CLI to use the latest version of the ALKS JS library.
- Outcome: The CLI is compatible with the new ALKS JS and passes all existing tests.

## Milestone 2: Add Support for New Headers
- Modify the CLI to send new headers required by the updated ALKS clients.
- Outcome: The CLI sends the correct headers when making requests, verified by inspection or test.


## Milestone 3: Add Commands for New/Existing CR
**Goal:**
Implement CLI command to support new and existing Change Requests (CR) using the updated ALKS JS and new parameters.

**Status:** Complete

- Implemented `alks cr` command and handler for Change Request (CR) support
- Added input validation and helpful error messages for required parameters
- Added unit tests in `src/lib/handlers/alks-cr.test.ts` covering error, prompt, and direct param scenarios
- All handler logic and parameter passing verified

**Outcome:** Users can provide a new or existing CR number as input, and the CLI processes it correctly.

## Milestone 4: Add Command for Workload/Component ID
- Add a CLI command or option to accept a workload or component ID as input.
- Outcome: The CLI accepts and passes the workload/component ID to ALKS as required.

## Milestone 5: Documentation and Progress Tracking
- Update user documentation and track progress in the implementation-progress.md file.
- Outcome: Documentation is up to date and progress is clearly tracked.
