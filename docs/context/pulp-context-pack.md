## Features Folder
- If there are other features in the `features` folder that are not in the `new_feature` folder, please ignore them for the purposes of implementing a new feature. The `new_feature` folder is the template for new features, and should be used as a guide for implementing new features.
- Please check the `features` folder for feature request info in the `new_feature` folder, specifically the `feature_summary.md` file within it. This will be used as a template. If one does not exist, that is fine.
- By default, the `features` folder will have a templated `new_feature` folder with a `feature_summary.md` file contained within it. In the course of implementing a feature, use the the `new_feature` folder as a template, but please create a new folder with the name of the feature being implemented under the `features` folder, and a new `feature_summary.md` file within it. The newly-created feature folder should be named with this pattern: YYMMDD_feature_name, where YY is the year, where MM is the month, DD is the day, and feature_name is a descriptive name for the feature being implemented. For example, if the feature being implemented is "Ice Cream Day Theme", and it is being implemented on October 1, 2023, the folder name would be `231003_ice_cream_day_theme`.
- Please move any `plan.md` files created to the newly created feature folder. This will be used to track the plan for implementing the feature.

## PULP Folder
- Please check the `.pulp` folder. If it does not exist, please create it at the root of the repo.
- If the `.pulp` folder exists, please check for the `userinfo.md` file. If it does not exist, please create it with the following content:
  - # Developer Description
    - ## Experience
        - A software engineer with 3 years of experience in Python and AWS. They have a solid understanding of AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, and REST APIs. They are familiar with ServiceNow and its ChangeAPI for managing change requests. They are comfortable with writing Python code and using libraries to interact with APIs.
    - ## Goals
        - Complete the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner certification
- After the `userinfo.md` file is checked or created, you must ask the user if they would like to keep the default values or modify them. If they choose to modify the file, please ask them to provide their own values for the experience and goals sections. Important Note: do not proceed with any other steps until you've asked for the the user to provide their input on modifying this file.
- Please include educational material in the `.pulp` folder, specifically under a `edu` folder, with a subfolder that matches the feature name in the `features` folder. The path should look like `.pulp/edu/<feature_name>/`, and match the name of the feature that is being implemented. The  `edu` folder should contain and have content as described below:
  - `learn.md`: in this file, please detail educational concepts for programming that have been encountered through the process of fulfilling requests by the user. In these learning notes, please provide links to sources online for a user to be able to solidify their learning and learn even more. Ensure this is suitable material for the developer described in the Developer Description section.
  - `review.md`: this file should contain a quiz based on the content mentioned in learn.md! Please make sure that it uses multiple choice questions are formatted using an ordered list that resembles a typical multiple choice quiz format, with A, B, C, and D being options for answers. Please ensure that each quiz answer option has its own separate line. Please make 10 questions in total. Do not put the answers in the review.md file. Instead, they should exist in a answers.md file within this edu folder that contains the answers, as mentioned below.
  - `answers.md`: this file should contain answers to the quiz in `review.md`. For each answer, when applicable, please provide example code snippets.
- If there is no `features` folder, please create the `.pulp/edu/` folder without a subfolder for the feature name. This will be used for general educational material that is not specific to a feature, and more in-line with programming concepts encountered during the course of fulfilling user requests.

## PULP Material Generation
- When fulfilling user requests, when it appears that a task has been completed and the user is satisfied, ask the user if they would like to generate educational material based on the task completed.
- If the user agrees, generate the educational material under the `.pulp` folder, either under the feature name subfolder or under the general `.pulp/edu/` folder if no feature name is applicable.
- If the user does agree to ask for educational material to be generated, after it is created, please ask the user if the would like to be quizzed on the material generated. If a user asks to be quizzed, ask them if they would prefer to be quizzed within the CoPilot terminal window, or on a separate webpage (this will be opened in a separate browser window for the user).
- If they choose the webpage option for their quiz, generate a webpage with an interactive quiz, and load that browser window. It should use `review.md` for the quiz questions, and `answers.md` for the answers. The webpage should be styled with CSS to make it visually appealing, and should include a submit button that allows the user to submit their answers (upon clicking Submit, this should display the user's score as a percentage correct out of 100%). Also, create a `web_certificate.svg` file in the same folder as the `review.md` file, with a congratulatory message, imagery containing stars, smiley faces, confetti, and imagery reflective of the work done, along with the date of completion. Display this certificate in the browser window after they click Submit and quiz is completed if their score is 70% or above.
- If they choose the CoPilot terminal window option for their quiz, use the `review.md` file to quiz the user, and provide their answers in an `attempt.md` file. Each `attempt.md` file should be created in the same folder as the `review.md` file, and should contain the user's answers to the quiz questions. The format of the `attempt.md` file should be similar to the `review.md` file, with the user's answers marked next to each question. The name of each `attempt.md` file should include the date and time of the attempt, formatted as `attempt_<date>_<time>.md`, where `<date>` is in the format `YYYYMMDD` and `<time>` is in the format `HHMMSS`. For example, if the user attempts the quiz on October 1, 2023 at 3:45 PM, the file name would be `attempt_20231001_154500.md`. If the user's score is above 70%, please congratulate them and ask if they would like to generate a certificate of completion. If they agree, create a `certificate.svg` file in the same folder as the `review.md` file, with a congratulatory message, imagery containing stars, smiley faces, confetti, and imagery reflective of the work done, along with the date of completion. If the user's score is below 70%, generate a `studyguide.md` file (in the same folder as `review.md`) that contains recommended learning material specific to incorrect answers that is separate from what already exists in `learn.md`. This should include links to online resources, tutorials, and documentation that can help the user improve their understanding of the concepts covered in the quiz.

## PULP Multi-Session Modes and Capabilities
- At any point, if the user asks to enter any of these modes, please follow the below instructions.
- "Big Quiz Mode": in this mode, the user will be quizzed on all educational material generated in the `.pulp/edu/` folder. The quiz will be based on the content of all `review.md` files in the `.pulp/edu/` folder, and the answers will be based on the corresponding `answers.md` files. The quiz will be presented in the same manner as described above, either in the CoPilot terminal window or on a separate webpage.
- "Visual Aid Mode": in this mode, the user will be shown visual aids related to the educational material generated in the `.pulp/edu/` folder. This could include diagrams, flowcharts, or other visual representations of concepts covered in the educational material. The visual aids will be displayed in a separate browser window (in the user's default browser, outside of VSCode) for easy viewing.
- "Discovery Mode": in this mode, the user will be prompted to provide the content of a Rally story. Then, a `primer.md` file will be created in the `.pulp/edu/` folder that contains a primer on the topic of the Rally story. The primer will include links to online resources, tutorials, and documentation that can help the user understand the topic better. The content of the `primer.md` file will be based on the content of the Rally story provided by the user. If the user does not provide a Rally story's contents, please ask them to provide it before proceeding with this mode. If the Rally story's contents are short or unclear, please ask the user to provide more details or a longer description of the story.
