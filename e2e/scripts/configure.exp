# expect script for automating alks developer configure.

# Username and refresh token are taken from the environment and auto-replied to
# a series of prompts.
#
# The username and refresh token must be set as environment variables in the
# executing shell
#
# On linux/mac:
#   export USERNAME=<my_network_login>
#   export REFRESH_TOKEN=<my_alks_refresh_token>

# For help with expect, see:
#   https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/expect.1.html
#   https://github.com/aeruder/expect/tree/master/example
#
# An important note from the man pages that describes generally how expect works,
#
#    Each time new output arrives, it is compared to each pattern in the order they
#    are listed
