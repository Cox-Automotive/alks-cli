    # Note: if this step is failing due to authentication errors, it is likely because you regenerated the npm-shrinkwrap.json 
    #   file while your local NPM was set to use the coxauto artifactory NPM registry. To fix this, locally delete your node_modules
    #   folder and npm-shrinkwrap.json file, then run `npm i --registry=https://registry.npmjs.org/` to reinstall using public NPM
    #   and then `npm shrinkwrap` to regenerate the npm-shrinkwrap.json file.
